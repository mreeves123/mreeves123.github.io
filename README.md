## Welcome to my Site

This is a page to show you some stuff about me.
I recently graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics from [Azusa Pacific University](https://www.apu.edu/). I love the outdoors, reading, and encouraging others to explore the intersection of math and technology. 


### My Love of Bison

My love of Bison all started when I visited [Custer State Park](https://gfp.sd.gov/parks/detail/custer-state-park/), located in South Dakota.

I find them to be one of the most fascinating creatures I have ever seen. Previously freely roaming the wild plains of North America, bison were killed in such great numbers that they can now only be found in national parks or residing closely outside of them. 

Top reasons bison are my favorite animal: 
1. They're majestic AF
2. They are community-oriented animals (they travel in herds)
3. Baby bison are the cutest
4. I'd like to ride one off into the sunset as my noble steed 

### Dark Green

In case you don't already know, I'm kind of obsessed with the color green. Just so you have a reference, I've added a picture below that displays my favorite hue.

### Mountains

Here's a nice picture of the mountains for your viewing eye. Personally, I'd rather be hammocking here than back in the city. I suppose that's what vacation time is for!
